summary: |-
  The goal is to measure the effect of video quality and the different types of browsers have on the energy consumption of youtube. 
  We are planning on using a variety of browsers such as chrome, edge, safari, opera and on each check a variety of qualities ranging from 240px - 4k. 
  This will also be tested on different laptops to both compare and average out the results to get a less biased view.

summary: |-
  Web browsers are among the most frequently used applications on personal computers,
  yet their energy consumption is rarely considered by end users. This study compares
  the energy consumption of three major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and
  Brave, while performing the same video streaming task. We aim to identify
  which browser is the most energy efficient choice for everyday video streaming, and
  quantify the practical impact of that choice.

## Introduction

Web browsers are one of the most heavily used categories of software on modern computers. Millions of users spend hours every day browsing the web, watching videos, and running web applications — often without considering the energy cost of the tool they use to do so. With growing awareness of software's environmental impact, understanding the energy footprint of everyday applications like browsers is increasingly relevant.

This project investigates a practically important question: **does the choice of web browser significantly affect energy consumption?** We focus on the video streaming use case, as it represents one of the most common and energy intensive browser workloads.

## Research Question

> Which web browser among Chrome, Firefox, and Brave consumes the least energy when streaming video content, and how large is the difference in practice?

## Experiment Design

We will compare the three browsers performing an identical task: streaming a fixed-length video (e.g., a 5-minute YouTube clip at 1080p) on the same machine, under controlled conditions.

**Independent variable:** Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave)

**Dependent variable:** Energy consumption  measured over the streaming session

**Controlled variables:**
- Same machine and OS
- Same video and streaming quality
- Screen brightness fixed
- Background processes minimised
- Each trial repeated at least 30 times to ensure statistical validity

summary: |-
    Screen time is often discussed in terms of productivity and mental health, but what about energy usage? In this post, we compare the system energy usage for different frequency of scrolling while doomscrolling Tiktok versus YouTube Shorts.

## Introduction

In 2025, people spent on average 141 minutes per day on social media[^time-spent]. That adds up to over 850 hours per person per year, much of it spent watching short-form content. A short break can easily turn into an endless session of watching a stream of recommended videos, a phenomenon known as "doomscrolling."

Every swipe has a cost beyond attention. The energy consumed by our devices to load, decode and play these videos is not something you might think about. In this project, we measure the total system power consumption while doomscrolling Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts to understand the energy usage of our social media habits.

If you're going to doomscroll, you might as well do it in an energy-efficient way.

## Motivation

## Methodology


### Experimental Setup


### Hardware/Software Details

### Normality
After the measurements are taken, it is important to ensure that data is normal. To measure normality, Shapiro-Wilk's test was performed. If the results do not assume normality, the points of data, deviating by more than 3 standard deviations from the mean were excluded and the Shapiro-Wilk's test was conducted again. If the results still did not indicate normality, the experiment was repeated.

### Statistical Significance
Group differences were evaluated using the Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal variances between groups. Statistical significance was determined using a α = 0.05.
### Effect Size

To evaluate the practical implication of the observed results, mean difference and percent change were calculated.
Cohen’s d was computed to measure statistical effect size. Effect sizes were interpreted according to conventional benchmarks:

Small effect: d ≈ 0.2

Medium effect: d ≈ 0.5

Large effect: d ≈ 0.8

While statistical difference is unlikely to arise by chance, the practical importance will be further evaluated in the discussion section.

## Results

Violin + Box plots, expect the shape and outliers of the data.

## Problem Statement
Modern software increasingly relies on desktop-based applications that mirror web functionality. This project investigates whether native desktop apps (e.g., Spotify Desktop) consume more energy than their browser-based equivalents under identical usage scenarios (idle, active, background). The study evaluates architectural overhead and its sustainability implications.

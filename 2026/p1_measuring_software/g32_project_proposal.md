## Introduction

Below are our proposed project proposals for the course, Sustainable Software Engineering. We mainly focused on <em>Same version, same app, but different running environment</em>, with the goal of better understanding the proposals efficiency and environmental impact.


### 1. Measuring Energy Consumption of a Simple Webpage (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
This project aims to analyze how much energy is consumed when loading and browsing a simple webpage using different browsers such as Chrome or Safari. The goal is to compare browser efficiency and identify differences in power usage.

### 2. Measuring Adblockers' Energy Consumption
This project aims to evaluate whether using adblockers increase or decrease overall energy consumption while browsing. It compares different adblockers or browsing with and without an adblocker to determine their impact on system power usage.

### 3. Measuring Energy Consumption of Local Language Models (e.g., using Ollama)
This project aims to investigate the energy usage of running language models locally on a machine using tools like Ollama. It focuses on how hardware resources (CPU/GPU) and model size influence power consumption.

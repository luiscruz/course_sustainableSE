title: "Energy Consumption of Static Analysis Tools"
summary: "As software development increasingly emphasizes sustainability, understanding the energy consumption of development tools has become essential. Static analysis tools, such as PMD, help improve code quality by detecting issues early in the development process. However, their computational cost and energy footprint remain largely unexplored. This paper investigates the energy consumption of PMD across different configurations, focusing on how ruleset complexity and code characteristics influence power usage."

title: "Assessing Sustainability of Software Libraries: A Framework inspired
by Nutri-Score"
group_number: 25
summary: "As the information and communication technology sector continues to grow, so does the environmental impact of software. However, assessing the sustainability of software libraries remains a complex and often low-priority task for developers. To support more informed and sustainable decision making, we present a classification framework that evaluates software libraries across multiple sustainability dimensions. Inspired by the Nutri-Score nutritional rating system, our approach translates complex sustainability data into a simple and intuitive label. We apply this framework to Python visualisation libraries and conduct experiments to evaluate and classify them. The results show significant differences in the sustainability of the libraries evaluated. Our framework provides developers with a simple and accessible way to compare software libraries, providing a valuable starting point for more sustainable software development."

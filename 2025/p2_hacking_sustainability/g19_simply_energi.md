title: "SimplyEnergi: Visualizations and Analysis for EnergiBridge"
group_number: 19
summary: "Due to the large impact software has on the
environment, it is crucial that software developers can gain
insights into the sustainability of their software. Current
solutions are either solely focused on data collection, spe-
cific to a domain, or not versatile enough regarding energy
metrics. We introduce SimplyEnergi, a system which allows
users to easily generate visualizations from a diverse set of
energy-related metrics. Furthermore, the application supports
standard statistical analysis of the metric measurements. The
system is an extension of EnergiBridge, which is an application
that allows users to collect data of the energy-related metrics
on different CPU, GPU and operating system configurations.
Qualitative validation with multiple testing datasets shows that
SimplyEnergi reliably generates accurate visualizations."

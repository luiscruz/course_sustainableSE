# Sustainable Software Engineering üå±
Edition of 2024/25<br/>
[MSc Computer Science] and [MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Technology], [Delft University of Technology]


**Sustainable Software Engineering** is an overarching discipline that addresses the long-term consequences of designing, building, and releasing a software project.
By definition, sustainability covers five main perspectives: **environmental**, **social**, **individual**, economic, technical.
This course focuses on the first three.

Software Engineering (SE) has long addressed sustainability by **narrowing it down to economical and technical sustainability**.
However, our society is facing major sustainability challenges that can no longer be overlooked by software engineers and computer scientists.
It was estimated that, **by 2040, the ICT sector will contribute to 14% of the global carbon footprint**. Hence, environmental, social, and individual ought to be part of the equation when it comes to design, build, and release software systems.
The problem is far from simple, but **we need expert computer scientists** to bring sustainability into the core values of the next generation of tech-leading organisations.

This course covers a set of competencies needed to leverage sustainable software systems.
It has a **strong component on Green SE**, covering techniques to measure and improve the energy-efficiency at any stage of the software lifecycle.
Students learn **state-of-the-art practices on energy efficiency** and apply them in real software projects. Moreover, the course will cover core principles of **empirical software engineering**, and **social and individual sustainability**.

## Assignments

Below the description of each project.

### üõ† **Project 1** ‚Äì Measuring Software Energy Consumption
{: #project1}

- Goal: Compare energy consumption in common software use cases.
  - Examples:
    - Different versions of the same app;
      - Same use case but different apps
      - Same version, same app, but different user settings (e.g., enable/disable GPU optimisation)
      - Same version, same app, but different running environment
- Blog-style report (markdown, approx 2500 words).
  - Bonus if you can automate the experiment and there is a replication package.

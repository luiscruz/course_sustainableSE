  Sustainability is often conceived of as an attempt to balance competing economic, environmental and social priorities. Over the course of three decades of scholarship, however, the meaning and appropriate application of the ‘social pillar’ continues to inspire confusion. In this paper, we posit that the inherent challenge of understanding social sustainability is its many legitimate meanings plus a lack of interdisciplinary scholarship. We draw from literature in multiple disciplines to illustrate five different ways that the concept of social sustainability has been applied in scholarship and professional practice, and highlighting the importance of applications that acknowledge placed-based, process-oriented perspectives that understand social, economic, and environmental imperatives as integrated concepts. Ironically, this framing forecloses on social sustainability as an entity distinct from environmental and economic sustainability. We believe that organizing the conversation around these five applications can help advocates of sustainability use the concept of social sustainability in clear and powerful ways while avoiding applications that relegate the social dimensions of sustainability to an afterthought.

  Sustainable development is often viewed through the Three Pillar Model as a balancing act between economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Exactly how the balancing act is performed varies greatly between applications in both academia and industry. Unfortunately, the social pillar is frequently neglected in favor of the other two pillars, which leads to less impactful and suboptimal sustainable development. The authors argue that the neglect of the social pillar stems from the fact that social priorities are inherently vague and context-dependent, making social sustainability difficult to understand and therefore difficult to apply. To increase the understanding of social sustainability, the authors propose a typology of five different ways in which social sustainability is applied in academia and industry. The typology is derived through literature review and illustrated through case studies.

  In their typology, social sustainability takes on a progressively more active and practical role until it is fully integrated with economic and environmental sustainability in the fifth approach. The differences between the approaches lie in how social sustainability is framed in relation to economic and environmental sustainability.
  In the first approach, each pillar is separate and independent, with development often focused solely on the economic pillar. Sustainable development then prioritizes economic growth at the expense of environmental and social decline.
  The second, third, and fourth approaches frame social sustainability as a constraint, a precondition, and a stimulant to economic and environmental change, respectively.
  In the second approach, only the social impacts of economic and environmental efforts are considered. As a result, development tends to only tackle small social sustainability problems that improve public image without any actual impact.
  In the third approach, social sustainability becomes a “social capital” used to compensate for the lack of economic capital, and social aspects are regarded as critical to upholding environmental sustainability. This view incentivizes investment into social capital.
  In the fourth approach, the root of economic and environmental problems are viewed as social and solutions therefore require social change to be successful.

  While approaches two, three, and four are more integrated than the first, they still treat sustainability as a set of separate notions, which reduces sustainability issues into economic, environmental, or social concerns. In reality, sustainable development involves complex, multi-faceted issues that cannot be easily categorized into one pillar. Different communities may experience the same issue as economic, environmental, or social depending on context. As a result, these issues are best solved with the fully integrated fifth approach which challenges the use of the popular Three Pillar Model. For sustainable development to be meaningful moving forward, practitioners should adopt a more holistic view of sustainability. To achieve this, more diverse and local stakeholders should be included in the decision-making process and particular attention should be paid to local experiences.

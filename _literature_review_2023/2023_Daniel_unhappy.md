  The growing literature on affect among software developers mostly reports on the linkage between happiness, software quality, and developer productivity. 
  Understanding happiness and unhappiness in all its components – positive and negative emotions and moods – is an attractive and important endeavor. 
  Scholars in industrial and organizational psychology have suggested that understanding happiness and unhappiness could lead to cost-effective ways of 
  enhancing working conditions, job performance, and to limiting the occurrence of psychological disorders. 
  Our comprehension of the consequences of (un)happiness among developers is still too shallow, being mainly expressed in terms of development 
  productivity and software quality. In this paper, we study what happens when developers are happy and unhappy while developing software. 
  Qualitative data analysis of responses given by 317 questionnaire participants identified 42 consequences of unhappiness and 32 of happiness. 
  We found consequences of happiness and unhappiness that are beneficial and detrimental for developers’ mental well-being, the software development process, 
  and the produced artifacts. Our classification scheme, available as open data enables new happiness research opportunities of cause-effect type, 
  and it can act as a guideline for practitioners for identifying damaging effects of unhappiness and for fostering happiness on the job.

  # Introduction
  
  The paper "What happens when software developers are (un)happy", is a paper based on the responses of 317
  software developers to a questionnaire. The paper was published in 2018
  and the questionnaire consisted of questions related to the developers'
  overall happiness at work and their satisfaction with different aspects
  of their job. The sample population consisted of software developers
  which had public profiles with contact information on GitHub, working in
  different fields, both open source and proprietary products. The
  questionnaire was sent out to a random subset of these developers, and
  317 valid responses were received. The responses were then put into
  categories for negative and positive responses, as well as various
  subcategories.

  The paper focuses on the individual part of sustainable software
  engineering and the purpose of the paper was to deepen the knowledge
  about which consequences, both to the developer and to the resulting
  work, could be observed when software developers are happy or unhappy.
  This is relevant for basically anyone working as software developer,
  such as company leaders, project managers, human resources employees or
  even customers that have direct contact with developers.

  # Related work

  In the introduction of the paper, the happy-productive worker thesis is
  introduced. The authors point to several studies that support the
  happy-productive worker thesis and give some examples of the concrete
  benefits that can arise when software developers are happy. For example,
  happy coders perceive themselves as being better problem solvers. It has
  also been shown empirically that there exists a positive correlation
  between positive affect and debugging performance.

  # Results

  After categorizing the responses the authors found 250 instances of
  negative consequences caused by unhappiness, as well as 340 instances of
  positive consequences caused by happiness. These instances were then
  divided into categories with the purpose to see which consequences were
  most common, the top five consequences resulting from happiness and
  unhappiness are presented in [\[happy\]](#happy){reference-type="ref"
  reference="happy"} and [2](#unhappy){reference-type="ref"
  reference="unhappy"} respectively. From these results, we can note that
  the top three consequences of both happiness and unhappiness are mirror
  images of each other, and that impact on productivity is the most
  commonly reported effect.
  
  Happy developers

  | Consequence         | Freq. |
  |--------------|-----------|
  |    High productivity                     |61|
  |    High motivation                       |42|
  |    High code quality                     |38|
  |    Higher self-accomplishment            |23|
  |    High work engagement/perseverance     |20|

  Unhappy developers

     | Consequence         | Freq. |
  |--------------|-----------|
  |   Low productivity     |59|
  |   Low code quality     |30|
  |   Low motivation       |21|
  |   Work withdrawal      |18|
  |   Delay                |18|

  Even though in total, more consequences of happiness were reported, the
  authors managed to categorize these consequences into 32 categories,
  whereas the consequences of unhappiness had to be divided into 42
  different categories. According to the authors, this is because the
  participants explained their negative experiences in more detail. The
  authors hypothesize that this might be because humans are prone to focus
  more on negative experiences.

  The authors also divided the instances of consequences into the
  categories *developer's own wellbeing* and *external* and found that in
  55 % of cases, unhappiness resulted in *external* consequences, whereas
  the same number for happiness was 48 %.

  # Conclusion

  Understanding happiness and unhappiness among developers is essential
  for creating a productive and stable work environment. If done correctly
  this can lead to higher productivity and better quality code, while
  mitigating stress, burnout and other adverse effects.

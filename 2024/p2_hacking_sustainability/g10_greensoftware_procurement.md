summary: "Green IT has become an increasingly relevant and impactful topic in the domain of Software Engineering. Nowadays,
software not only needs to be efficient, but also sustainable. In a world where energy and resources used in computers
are becoming more scarce and where climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our species, research
needs to be done on how to make IT more sustainable. An important component of making sustainable software
more adopted by governments and corporations is the procurement of green software. Therefore, in this paper, we
present FISHER, an experimental framework based on earlier research in sustainable software that helps people and
corporations with sustainable software procurement. Our framework is based on three categories, with criteria that
extend beyond the basics of the sustainability of the software itself and also focus on the social sustainability of the
company itself. Additionally, we provide a basic implementation of our framework as a Proof of Concept (POC),
that can already be used for sustainable software procurement."

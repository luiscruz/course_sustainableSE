summary: "Energy consumption is becoming increasingly important as the discussion about a sustainable (digital)
world continues. To reduce carbon emissions, developers needs more tools to be aware of the changing
energy consumption of their software. There exist tools that provide insight into the carbon impact of your software. However, most tools report the carbon footprint for the running system as a whole and do not provide a way to track energy efficiency improvements. In this paper, we present a set of Python packages that can report the energy usage of methods, as well as integrate into existing testing frameworks. This enables developers to be aware of, and validate, the energy consumption for their software."
